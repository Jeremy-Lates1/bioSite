          Erin was born in Providence Rhode Island in 1991 at Woman and Infants
          Hospital. He grew up mostly in and around Providence RI until he was a
          freshman in High School where he moved to Hollis New Hampshire. Hollis
          is a small New Hampshire farming town with a population size of
          approximately 7000, which is much different than the city of
          Providence which has a population of 190,000. This was a nice change
          for Erin as he felt like he had better educational opportunities in
          Hollis. His favorite class was English because you could express
          yourself through writing.

          Erin started his career by finding a cook position at St. Joseph’s
          Hospital in Nashua New Hampshire. He found the position through
          Project Search, a program preparing young people with disabilities for
          successful employment. Erin excelled in this program and gave many
          speeches on his success to aspiring program members. Erin is currently
          a Food Prep Cook and he works the FLIK company which provides
          corporate dining for one of its clients, Fidelity Investments, in
          Merrimack New Hampshire.

          Erin’s hobbies include watching and playing basketball as well as
          playing video games. Erin’s favorite basketball team is the Boston
          Celtics. His favorite player is Jason Tatum because he is a good
          three-point shooter and he is an excellent role model. Erin’s favorite
          video game is Super Mario Brothers. He enjoys playing this game
          because you can gain points for achievements while playing the game.
          His favorite part is when he beats the game which he finds this very
          satisfying. Erin also likes to travel, although he admits he has not
          been many places. The most rememberable one was a trip to Los Angeles
          California. He hopes to take similar trips in the future.
