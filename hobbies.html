            Erin and I went for a walk and I interviewed him. I learned that one
            of Erinâ€™s favorite things to do is play video games. He mentioned
            Super Mario Brothers and NBA Live 2K on his new Play Station 5. Erin
            also shared with me that he likes to travel even though he has not
            been many places yet. His most rememberable trip was to California
            where he stayed in Los Angeles and San Francisco. There is a picture
            above of Erin in front of the Hollywood sign in LA.

            Erin loves basketball. His favorite team is the Boston Celtics and
            his favorite player is Jason Tatum. Erin also is a cook by
            profession but also likes to cook for the family, like grilling
            cheeseburgers for example. Last, Erin likes to take photos of
            scenery. He does not have a fancy camera he just uses his phone and
            captures beautiful pictures like the picture of the lake with the
            dock in it.
